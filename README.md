# openfactorio

This repository contains a collection of my **casual** attempts at documenting the multiplayer factorio protocol.
The goal is not to allow for a complete server and/or client (re-)implementation nor even to provide anywhere near a complete protocol documentation;
I'm just doing this for fun.

Anything beyond this text block should be taken with a grain of salt and will probably change as I figure out more of how the protocol works.

## General observations

-   UDP
